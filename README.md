# festival_nanogenmo_2020

This is a NaNoGenMo 2020 project run by by Lesia Tkacz and Noriko Suzuki-Bosco as a workshop for the University of Southampton Humans Worlds Festival 2020. 
All authors and collaborators are listed in the PDF of the submitted generated novel. More Infomation about the novel can be found on its NaNoGenMo 2020 issue page: https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2020/issues/58

The code uses Markovify to generate a mashup style novel. it reads all the input files in a directory, and trains Markovify on their content. 
Sentences are generated along with numbered chapter headings (ex. 'Chapter 15').

The code produces a text file showing approximately how many words the novel has, and a table of contents listing the numbered chapter headings.
