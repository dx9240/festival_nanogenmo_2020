Now it was the law at this time in Iceland that when any man had been
killed his nearest relatives came to the assize, and the slayer appeared
by proxy and offered blood-money—that is to say, to pay a fine to the
relations, and so patch up the quarrel.  But if they refused the money
then they were at liberty to pursue and kill him.  There were no police
then.  If the relations wanted to have the criminal punished, they must
punish him themselves.


The pain became more acute, and the whole leg inflamed and swollen,
signs of mortification appeared, and wounds opened in different parts of
the limb, so that Grettir felt that the shadow of death hung over him.
Illugi sat night and day with his brother’s head on his shoulder,
bathing his forehead, and doing his utmost to console the fleeting
spirit. A week had elapsed since the wound had been made.
