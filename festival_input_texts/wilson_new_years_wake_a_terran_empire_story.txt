Sue felt herself relaxing as warmth crept back into her, and she
automatically evaluated her surroundings.  They were nothing like what
she was used to: a small living room, festively decorated but obviously
not rich--more homey, she thought, than anything else.  Bookshelves
lined one wall almost completely, their ranks broken only by two small
windows and a holoset--on, but being ignored; she couldn't tell what
the program was.  A five- or six-person table held food and drinks; it
looked too heavy to move easily, so this was probably the dining room,
as well.  Wall decorations were mostly stitchery, though a crucifix
held a place of honor above the mantel.

Not a rich place, no.  And the party talk around her, gathered in
fragments from the twenty or so who crowded the room, didn't contradict
that impression.  This seemed to be a subsistence-farming culture
. . . here on Terra?  Well, it was possible; talk of farm animals,
equipment, and markets, and canning, yes.  Nothing of politics, or the
Empire, or the nobility, as was so common in the circles she was used to,
but the warmth and friendship here had value of their own.  These people
might not have much money, but they couldn't be called poor.

Sue found herself pleased by that.  It was people like these, after
all, who were the Empire's substance, its reason for being.  It was
good to be reminded of that, from time to time.  Imperial nobles and
officers had the trappings of rank, yes, but the underlying purpose of
that rank was to insure that Imperial citizens like these could live
freely and without fear.  And she was one of those officers . . .   Sue
smiled to herself, and kept listening as carefully as Bridget kept her
chocolate cup full and hot.
